    "**Step 1:** The first thing we need to do is create a `PECollapser` object from the module collapse.py. This class takes as inputs: the filepath to the parameter explorer file, the name you want to assign to your data, the planet radius in pixels (ra), the planet position angle (pa), and your chosen highpass filter size in pixels (we usually go with 1/2 the FWHM). It also allows you to choose how you want to handle the planet dimension of the parameter explorer if you injected more than one planet i.e. if you want to mean or median collapse in that dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Next, we generate the result from collapsing across planets (*further functionality added later*). The output is a dictionary, which I'm going to turn into a pandas dataframe to make things slightly easier. "
